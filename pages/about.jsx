      <h3>Technology Behind This Portal</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p>🌄 This is a responsive server-side rendered (SSR) portfolio website built with Next.js.</p>
      <p>📦 Containerized via Docker with Alpine Linux and deployed to Google Cloud Run as a serverless microservice.</p>
      <p>💬 Why serverless: the app runs without concerns about provisioning machines, configuring clusters, or autoscaling.</p>
      <p>☁️ Why Cloud Run: the app is maintained in a fully-managed compute environment for deploying and scaling serverless HTTP containers.</p>
      <p>🚀 In other words, quick deployment of a serverless container as a private microservice with custom RESTful web APIs.</p>
